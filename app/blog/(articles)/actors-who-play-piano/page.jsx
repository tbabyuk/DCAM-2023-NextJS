                        instructor, it is hardly surprising that Sandra Bullock began learning both singing and piano as a child. Although her parents hoped for their daughter to have a career in music - we are sure they aren't disappointed with how she turned out! Bullock has shown off her piano skills in several TV shows and movies, like “The Net”.</p>
